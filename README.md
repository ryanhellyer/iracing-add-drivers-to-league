# iRacing Add Drivers To League - Google Chrome extension
Chrome extension which allows for automatic adding of drivers to a league on iRacing.

On installation you will see a new Chrome pulldown which includes some very basic instructions on how to use the extension.

This is a very basic extension is only intended as a one off tool for bulk adding new members. I literally just built it to use once, and will probably never use it again. It worked flawlessly as of 2018-02-21, but I can't guarantee it will work in future ;)
